# dot-matrix

## Backstory

In my daily role, I am often testing out new approaches to problems and playing with various packages to see how they might apply to a given situation. To make this easier / more applicable, I use some project as the basis for the test. For some reason, a matrix of dots is something that recurs often in my testing ... thus this library.
